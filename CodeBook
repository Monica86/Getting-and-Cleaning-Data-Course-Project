ORIGINAL DATA
The raw data used for this project is labeled as "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" taken from the website  "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones". 
As specified in the website, this dataset was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. * For more info, please check the above mentioned website.
    
    VARIABLES FROM THE RAW DATA USED


TRANSFORMATIONS DONE:
1) Basic readable:
    - test_x<-read.table(".\\test\\X_test.txt",sep="") -> To have the x-test data properly divided in variables
    - test_y<-read.table(".\\test\\Y_test.txt",sep="") -> To have the x-test data properly readable
2) Have an overview of the content:
    ftable(subject_test)
    ftable(test_y)
    summary(test_x)    
        when doing the summary(test_x) you realize that there is no variable that can be used as key with those 2 dataset 
        (subject_test and test_y). Therefore we must assume that the key will be the implicit ID (the order starting from 1 to 2947)
